# Custom Bluetooth Controller

This project was my attempt to create a custom controller that can be connected to a computer in order to play basic computer games and potentially to offer an alternative option to a mouse and keyboard.

# First Milestone

My first milestone was creating a circuit that uses: an Arduino Micro, pushbuttons, and resistors, in order to remotely trigger a keyboard response (the arrow keys in particular).

The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.

# Second Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.
